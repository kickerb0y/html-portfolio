<h1>The Best Movies According to Kent</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lift</h3>
<p>Lift takes the heist genre to new heights with a thrilling and audacious plot that unfolds on the soaring wings of a 777 passenger flight.</p>
<h3>6 Underground</h3>
<p>Fantabulously amazing best describes the overall movie's theme and storyline.</p>
<h3>Army of the Thieves</h3>
<p>I really loved the move. Far better then it's "sequel", but name of the movie "Army of Thieves" is totally wrong and it misses the point of the whole movie.</p>
